# Conversational-Payments

Conversational Payment is a simple tool that helps you to make payments through voice commands . It is used to ease the user out of making payments conventionally where he would open app , select contact , enter amount , enter pin etc. Here you just need to make a command like "Send 500 to Akshat" and it will transfer 500 to Akshat after entering the passcode , hence reducing steps
